# Bike-Maintain
Bike-Maintain is a modified udemy course, Learn Vue JS 3 & Firebase, project by Net Ninja.

Change site styles and changed the site Firebase Project and Datastructures.  Added fields to the songs document and changed the output to Maintenance Logs by changing the author to details, and added a date field.  
Altered the CSS by adding media queries to make the site work on small devices.
Now users can add bikes, and then add maintenance logs to that bike.
